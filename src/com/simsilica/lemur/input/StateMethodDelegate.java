/**
 *  A convenience StateFunctionListener implementation that
 *  can call a method using reflection.  By default, the method
 *  is called on the "release" of a particular function, ie: when
 *  its state returns to Off.  Methods that take an InputState
 *  argument and are called by a StateMethodDelegate with the
 *  "takesArgument" parameter as 'true' will receive all events,
 *  POSTIVE, Negative, and Off.
