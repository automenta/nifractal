/**
 *  A style selector that matches a specific
 *  element ID.  Note: the selector may still refer
 *  to parts of a composite element ID and "children" in
 *  that case will inherit attributes of their parents.
 *  In other words, using an ElementSelector("thumb") to
 *  set attributes for a particular style can affect all
 *  thumbs in any composite component, slider.thumb, scroll.thumb,
 *  etc..
 *
 *  <p>Note: mostly callers do not have to worry about
 *  the specifics of this class as there are methods
 *  on Styles that create these selectors internally.</p>
