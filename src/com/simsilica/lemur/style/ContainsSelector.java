/**
 *  A style selector that matches any element with the
 *  specified child ID and parent ID.  For example, if
 *  an element ID is "slider.thumb.button" then there
 *  are several "parent"/"child" relationships:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>slider, thumb</li>
 *  <li>slider, button</li>
 *  <li>thumb, button</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  A ContainsSelector of ("slider", "button") would match
 *  any of a slider's buttons, to include the thumb or
 *  any arrow buttons, etc..
 *
 *  <p>Note: mostly callers do not have to worry about
 *  the specifics of this class as there are methods
 *  on Styles that create these selectors internally.</p>
