/**
 *  Tracks an update version of a VersionedObject and can
 *  provide basic change tracking for a caller.  Calling code
 *  can hold a VersionedReference to some value and call
 *  update() to update the local version field and detect
 *  if the version has changed since the last check.
 *
 *  <p>This is an upside-down way of doing change notification
 *  that does not have the event overhead or listener-leak
 *  potential of a typical event/listener framework.  It is
 *  not appropriate for all cases but can be used in cases
 *  where values are often changed frequently and/or it's ok
 *  to ignore stacks of events in favor of the latest value.
 *  Common applications are things like sliders, document models,
 *  etc. for which some view will update itself only when the
 *  watched object changes, but otherwise doesn't care about
 *  the specific granularity of events.</p>
